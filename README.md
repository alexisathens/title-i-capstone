## Master's capstone evaluating spending equity in Title I schools across Utah

*Per-Student Spending by Title I Status in Utah: An Equity Analysis* was my Master's capstone project (PUBPL6950) completed in Spring 2022. Per-student spending was assessed for Utah schools excluding supplementary, federal Title I program funds to determine whether base spending was comparable between Title I and non-Title I schools.

Linear and hierarchical models were used in the analysis. Model results showed that spending at Title I schools was comparable to non-Title I schools within the same district. However, overall per-student spending was 8% lower at Title I schools when compared to non-Title I schools across districts in Utah. 

This suggests that school districts largely determine spending levels and that Title I schools are unevenly concentrated across districts. Thus, the state is uniquely positioned to address this inequity in per-student spending at Title I schools across Utah.
